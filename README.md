This is a basic app for memorization of German vocabulary. You can create your own course and add
units and words.
Words are revised after a while depending on how well you remembered them the last time.

Get motivational messages after each lesson and track your progress throughout the courses you
study.

Enjoy the minimalist design where nothing will distract you from your studies.

Try out new features as they come out and reach out with your valuable feedback.

# Key Features:

- creating editing and managing your own courses.
- see your progress with XP and word count
- easy to memorize nouns with important info about them(gender and plural form)
- see your mistakes in a lesson when checking
- get motivated at the end of each lesson to keep learning further
- works offline

## Requirements

Android 8.0+

# Why?

I had experience using different language learning apps and all of them has its weak points and
strengths. What I want to achieve is a service focused on learning German vocabulary.

So, I explicitly included choice for an article and plural form. Words will be revised after a
certain point in time, but not all at once like an avalanche making the learning experience less
overwhelming.

I want more drama while learning a language!

I started working on this while going through android studio with jetpack compose course, which
was quite helpful in many ways.

# Project state and road map:

## Currently working on:

Writing more test to easier extend the functionality of the app as well some new features. And
creating documentation for it.
