Words are revised after a while depending on how well you remembered them the last time.

Get motivational messages after each lesson and track your progress throughout the courses you study.

Enjoy the minimalist design where nothing will distract you from your studies.

## Requirements
Android 8.0+
# Why?
I had experience using different language learning apps and all of them has its weak points and 
strengths. What I want to achieve is a service focused on learning German vocabulary.

So, I explicitly included choice for an article and plural form. Words will be revised after a 
certain point in time, but not all at once like an avalanche making the learning experience less overwhelming.

I want more drama while learning a language!

I started working on this while going through android studio with jetpack compose course, which was quite helpful in many ways.
