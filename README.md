# Description
Working name genau(subject to change). This hopefully will be a basic app for memorization of German vocabulary.

Currently the basic functionality is mostly working. Hopefully it will be fully functional soon enough. But in the future it will be updated with more features and perks.

I started working on this while going through android studio with jetpack compose course, which was quite helpful in many ways.
## Requirements
Android 8.0+
# Why?
I had experience using different language learning apps and all of them has its weak points and strengths. What I want to achieve is a service focused on learning German vocabulary.

So, I explicitly included choice for an article and plural form. Words will be revised after a certain point in time, but not all at once like an avalanche making the learning experience less overwhelming.

The final message after the lesson will depend on how well you did. I want it to be both meaner and nicer than a green owl. I want more drama while learning a language!

# Key Features:
Memorization of German vocabulary made easy in a fun and customized way. No courses are available yet. Currently working on implementing the basic functionality first.
